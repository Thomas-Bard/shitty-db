# shitty-db
A shitty database system made in C which is meant to be used with my other project network-server-asm

## Disclaimer
This isn't meant to be safe at all, it's just a project where I want to prove the superiority of low level languages, and that even today there are still people that love computers and that are still able to make hard project without using tools we take for granted like MySQL or NodeJS. This is just a side project that helps me learn a lot about how computers and networking works.

### ⚠️ THIS IS WHY I WILL DELIBERATLY NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT THE TERRIBLE LACK OF SECURITY OF THIS PROJECT ⚠️
> Otherwise any constructive criticism about the code quality will be well received !
